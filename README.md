We've created a new project called [**stackmix**](https://github.com/roxiness/stackmix). It's an experimental CLI that let's you pick and mix all features in a Routify template! Get started with `npx stackmix`


# Scripts

Run with `npm run <command>`, for example `npm run dev`

| Command   | Description                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `dev`     | Development (port 5000)                       |
| `build`   | Build your app for production!                |
| `preview` | Preview the built version of your app locally |
